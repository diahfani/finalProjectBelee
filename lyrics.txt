Nobody sees when you beat your chest
When you’re out of life
No one comes by
 
Sometimes it’s fine not to be your best
Come take your time
‘cause I feel you
 
Out of this whole wide world
There’s no one to talk to
It’s funny how when you need someone the most
You just wanna be alone
 
Look up at the moon
And I know you’re wishin’ upon the same night sky
It calls for your name
Whenever the clock hits eleven elevеn
You, (you)
I know you’re barely gettin’ by
Just call for my namе
I’ll send a hug through the moon
 
Lovin’ gets hard when you don’t love yourself
You gotta trust
To put yourself first
 
Sometimes it’s work just to stay alive
I know it's tough
But I know you’ll get through
 
Out of this whole wide world
There’s noone to talk to
Its funny how when you need someone the most
You just wanna be alone
 
Look up at the moon
And I know you’re wishin’ upon the same night sky
It calls for your name
Whenever the clock hits eleven eleven
You, (you)
I know you’re barely gettin’ by
Just call for my name
I’ll send a hug through the moon
 
Look up at the moon
And I know you’re wishin’ upon the same night sky
It calls for your name
Whenever the clock hits eleven eleven
You, (you)
I know you’re barely gettin’ by
Just call for my name
I’ll send a hug through the moon
